title: "Puccini TOSCA Compiler"
description: "Contributed to the Go implementation of the open-source Puccini TOSCA compiler by implementing the grammar specification for TOSCA 2.0. This work involved mapping the new standard definitions into the existing codebase to enable validation of updated topology templates. Following the successful integration of my work, I was invited by the project creator to become a core maintainer of the repository."

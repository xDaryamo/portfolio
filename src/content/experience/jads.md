summary: "Conducted research on Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) interoperability as part of my Master’s Thesis. I engineered a proof-of-concept pipeline to reverse-engineer proprietary AWS Terraform configurations into the open standard TOSCA 2.0, comparing deterministic parsing techniques against AI-driven approaches using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)."
achievements:
  - "Core Contributor to **[Puccini](https://github.com/tliron/puccini)**: Implemented full TOSCA 2.0 grammar support in the **puccini** TOSCA compiler. My contributions were merged upstream, leading to my promotion as a Project Maintainer."
  - "IaC Transpilation: Developed a hybrid conversion engine capable of mapping complex cloud infrastructure states to standardized topology templates."
  - "RAG Implementation: Experimented with LLMs to automate the translation of non-standard infrastructure definitions, enhancing semantic mapping accuracy."
tech:
  - Go
  - Terraform
  - TOSCA
  - Python
  - LangChain/RAG
